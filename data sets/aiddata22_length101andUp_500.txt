1998450	Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)		Food and Agricultural Sector Restructuring Program	Food and Agricultural Sector Loan	The program aims to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of Mexico's food and agriculture sector, as well as restructure the sector's production system and facilitate the adjustment of low-income producers and consumers to the new system. While improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the sector is an important objective of this operation, the program also supports direct food- and income-support mechanisms for impoverished groups of producers and consumers. Those mechanisms will facilitate the adjustment for those population groups, enabling the government to undertake necessary macroeconomic reforms, including lifting price controls, divesting state-controlled grain storage infrastructure, and developing private farm-commodity markets and other private financial instruments. This project will be executed jointly by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.  The program will benefit Mexico by helping to establish a sustainable foundation for its participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It will do this by encouraging the reallocation of resources on a competitive basis and maximizing the contribution of the food and agriculture sector to the national economy. Implementation of the policies supported by this loan will ease fiscal spending pressures for food and agriculture, increase fiscal spending transparency, and better target subsidies aimed at the poorest population segments.	31191.03|31110.02 	1563

2433267	International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)		North-West Frontier Province Barani Area Development Project		The overall goals of this seven-year, AsDB-initiated project are to reduce  poverty in remote areas, particularly among smallholders and the landless and  improve the status of rural women. In these traditionally conservative areas,  women bear a disproportionate burden of poverty because of their low social  status, limited access to economic opportunities and social services, and limited  ownership of productive assets such as land and capital. Their level of education  and health is among the lowest in the province. Specific objectives include:  (i) improved agricultural and natural-resource management practices;  (ii) enhanced community infrastructure in order to increase the value and/or  reduce the costs of village activities; and (iii) improved rural livelihood opportunities  and alternatives, including specific measures to increase women’s access to  social and economic resources. The project covers 832 villages located in nine districts  and one federal agency, directly reaching approximately 83 000 households  and benefiting small farmers, landless farm labourers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers  and those engaged in rural off-farm occupations.	16010.05|43040.05|31110.02|42010.04|41010.02 	1235

Due to a lack of funds, the Instituto de Credito Educatiuo (EDUCREDITO), the Government agency which provides educational loans to needy students, has been unable to meet the rising demand for such assistance.  This loan will enable EDUCREDITO to provide substantial additional credit resources to train students in economic development skills. Under the program, which will chiefly favor students from low-income families, some 515 student loans will be provided-295 for technical and undergraduate studies in Honduras and 220 for postgraduate study in other Bank member countries.  Up to $31,000 of the loan will be used for technical cooperation to finance the hiring of consultants to advise EDUCREDITO on administrative procedures and the continuous review of the type of human resources needed in Honduras, as well as study abroad for qualified professional EDUCREDITO personnel.	11420.02|11420.04|11420.06 	1138

The Companhia Energetics de Minas Gerais (CEM/G), the energy agency of the State o fMinas Gerais, accounts for 90 per cent of the state's electricity output. Following an average annual increase of 16 per cent in 1975-80, the growth in demand for CE_MIG's electric power declined dramatically in 1980-83 due to the economic recession. With the upturn in the economy in 1984. however, the volume of electric power sales rose almost 17 per cent. To keep abreast of demand, CEM/G plans over the 1985-94 period to extend its transmission and subtransmission network by 10,873 kilometers. To cooperate with this effort, the Bank in 1985 approved a $56 million loan from the interregional capital to help  build almost 2,400 kilometers of transmission and subtransmission lines to handle the increased demand for electric power in the state.The program includes a subprogram to build 597 kilometers of 500-, 345- and 138-kilovolt trans-mission lines and to expand substations: a multiple•works subprogram to build 1,790 kilometers of 34.5-, 69- and 138•kilovolt subtransmission lines, and a subprogram to train CEMfG's staff in the electric power companies of member countries and in specialized institutions.	23081.01|23040.01|23040.03|23040.02 	1659

2412498	Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA)		Construction of Butaré-Ntendezi-Cyangugu Road	<br>	SECTOR  Having no railways or navigable waterways Rwanda depends entirely on road transport which consequently occupies a central position in the country's development planning. In Rwanda's second Five-Year Plan 1977-1981, the transport sector accounted for 26 per cent of total investment, with 22 per cent being earmarked for road transport alone.   The project, which BADEA cofinances, is designed to create an all-weather connection between the towns of Cyangugu on the Zaire frontier and Butaré. Replacing an existing and much degrades road, the new highway will provide a permanent and reliable outlet  for the agricultural produce of the southwestern region, and will help trade with neighboring countries.   The construction of a 153-kilometre paved road is envisaged. The asphalted carriageway will be 6 metres wide with shoulders of 1.5 metres on either side.     OBJECTIVE  Broadly, the Rwanda Government's objectives where road transport is concerned are to improve connections with neighboring countries, upgrade and improve the maintenance of the national road network, and facilitate economic,  social and administrative integration of the country. With 240 metres of road per square kilometre, Rwanda can claim one  of the highest road densities in Africa. But only 440 km are paved out of the total of 2,280 km of classified roads, the  rest being earth roads, rural tracks and other inferior communications which are generally in a poor state of repair.  Another 4,000 km of rural roads are unclassified. Furthermore, during the long rainy season, September-May,  most of the roads, particularly the present link between Butaré and Cyangugu, are very difficult to pass.   The project will improve traffic on a route that is both nationally and regionally important. Taking into consideration the average cost of vehicle usage, benefits expected from increased road traffic, and savings on the maintenance of the existing road, the project should yield an economic return in the region of 11.6 per cent.	21020.02 	2075

"This project will increase access to primary education among disadvantaged children living in nine selected states-Colima, Chihuahua, Mexico, Nayarit, Queretaro, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa. Sonora and Zacatecas-providing improved opportunities for children living in small and/or isolated communities and for those born into homes where the parents have little or no formal education of their own. At the same time, parents will he provided informal, first-time instruction in child-rearing. A separate component of the program will promote literacy through the recruitment and training of approximately 97,000 community-based workers, through adult-education programs administered by the Instituto Nacional para la Educacion de Adultos, INEA. Overall, the goals of the primary education component of the program are to improve formal primary education in 385 municipalities displaying educational indicators below the national average and an additional 72 municipalities made up of indigenous communities, thus benefiting an estimated 1.1million children. In the second major component, to he implemented in 23 states, children receiving ""community education""-in remote communities with less than 100 inhabitants-will see the quality of education improved in 18,000 schools through the definition of clear curricula, the provision of teachers' guides and other learning materials and the construction of an additional 14,000 new schools. In a series of activities related to parenting, roughly 76,000 parents will benefit from activities designed to stimulate the physical, cognitive, affective and psychomotor development of their children-including guidance in nutrition and instruction in various means of offering emotional and psychological support. Another initiative financed as part of the overall program will permit the Consejo Nacional de Fumento Educativo, CONAFE, to concentrate on preschooling for a total of over 90,000 four and five year-olds in rural communities."	11230.02|12240.05|11220.05|11220.03|11220.02|11110.06|11220.06|11240.02|11220.04|11230.03 	2053

The Bank already made three loans towards this program. The Government of Italy submitted a number of projects in three categories: industry, irrigation, and electric power. They are all designed to meet the established needs of the Southern Italy economy. A final selection was made consisting of 10 industrial projects, one irrigation project and three power projects. The Flumendosa irrigation project is one integral part of the Cassa program in Sardinia and is the only large single opportunity to increase agricultural production on the island. The three power projects, two on the mainland and one in Sicily, will all be needed to meet the growing demand for electricity which is evidence of the success of the Cassa program to foster the economic development of southern Italy. The various industrial plants, of which seven are on the mainland, two in Sicily and one in Qardinia, will complement the projects of the Cassa program. The impact of the project on the economy of the region will be very significant. The increase in farm production will provide additional business to traders, processors, transporters of agricultural commodities, as well as to those who supply the farmers with goods and services. The project will also have a favorable influence on employment, the number of man-days in agriculture alone will increase dramatically.	23040.01|31140.02|32105.01|23020.01 	1567

2017386	OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)		Balkan Velayat Water Supply		With the inhospitable Karakum desert occupying 80% of the total land area, Turkmenistan is the driest country in Central Asia, measured in terms of the availability of its water resources.  This situation has been exacerbated by the disastrous  exploitation of the Aral Sea and its feeder rivers for cotton irrigation. Over the past 30 years, the Sea has shrunk to a fourth of its previous size, and the water level has dropped by nearly 20 meters. These developments have caused the contamination and rising salinity of the ground water, the Amu Darya River and the Karakum Canal, the country’s main sources of drinking water. Moreover, as in other former Soviet republics, the water supply transmission and distribution systems are in dreadful condition.  Half of all treated water is lost through leakage, while another 50% becomes contaminated as it flows through deteriorated distribution lines.  Currently, over one-third of the population has no access to clean drinking water. Conditions are particularly bad in Balkan Velayat (district), where water rationing is particularly frequent and water-borne diseases prevalent. Nearly all of the velayat’s water is drawn either from the Karakum Canal or from wells in the Yaskhan fields, but these sources are becoming exhausted, in part because of a rapid increase in population size. This loan will co-finance an initiative to improve the availability and quality of drinking water for the velayat’s 400,000 inhabitants. To achieve this goal, the project will implement a wide range of activities to prevent water losses and contamination and to increase coverage and  efficiency. Over 145 new wells will be drilled, a 40 km-long transmission line will be installed to connect the Yaskhan area with the city of Nebitdag, the entire water transmission and distribution network will be rehabilitated and expanded, and reservoirs, pumping stations and wastewater treatment stations will be built. The new wells will double the amount of water available from the Yaskhan source to 70,000 m3 per day. The improvements undertaken by the project are expected not only to overcome current water shortages but also to satisfy projected demands to the year 2005.	14020.05|14020.04|14040.04 	2242

As a step towards deciding how to meet these challenges, the Bank in 1981 approved a $40,000 technical cooperation grant from the Social Progress Trust Fund for a three-day seminar held in Mexico City Feb. 11-13 on food production and distribution strategies. Emphasis at the seminar was placed on the experiences of various countries in food production and distribution, the external financing of agricultural development, the impact of food on Latin America's international trade and the foundation of food strategies.  	31181.01 	797

2443124	Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)		Multi-Country Program to Fight Tuberculosis		"Background and Summary  As Small Island States, the 11 countries included in this Program face many significant development challenges and these define their capacities to address HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (""TB""). The nature of these challenges is described below.  TB prevalence in some populations in these countries is amongst the highest in the Western Pacific.  The Program targets specific populations identified as vulnerable. It is built on the experiences and successes of the Round 2 Grant, which will end when this proposal is scheduled to commence.  Many Pacific Island Countries and Territories (""PICTs"") have widely dispersed populations combined with rapidly growing and densely populated urban areas. These combined population pressures create significant problems for delivering consistent TB control services to all communities, particularly those living in remote outer islands. Consequently, there is significant variability in case detection and treatment success rates throughout the target PICTs. In the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for example, case detection rates are lower than 40%, whereas in Kiribati, case detection is close to 100%. In Nauru, the treatment success rate is less than 50%, while in Tonga it is nearly 100%. As a result of this variability, there are pockets of extreme vulnerability to TB throughout the region, and these heighten the general vulnerability to TB across all PICTs. While the burden falls on all population groups within the targeted PICTs, the impacts are more severe in highly vulnerable populations prisoners, urban poor (high density populations), outer island populations, immigrants, seafarers and diabetics.  Challenges to successful treatment and control include:  â?¢ Outdated national operational guidelines and policies combined with poor adherence  â?¢ Lack of human resources within National TB Programs (NTPs) and associated health service delivery programs  â?¢ Lack of transportation, hindering access to populations  â?¢ Patchy implementation of the International Standards for Treatment and Care (ISTC)  â?¢ Low levels and/or untargeted contact tracing  â?¢ Inefficient quality assurance (QA) systems within diagnostic laboratory services  â?¢ Inadequate pharmacy systems to support the procurement and distribution of anti-TB drugs  â?¢ Limited TB ward capacity in some PICTs resulting in increasing numbers of cases with unsupervised treatment  â?¢ Underdeveloped M&E systems  â?¢ Inefficient data reporting, quality, analysis and utilization; and  â?¢ Limited advocacy, communication and social mobilization (ACSM) plans and approaches.  These issues are further compounded by the challenges posed by MDR-TB and TB/HIV coinfection  Planned Activities  Planned summary level activities include;  National & regional level training to strengthen TB laboratory diagnosis and compliance with EQA protocols  Maintaining and upgrading laboratory equipment  Strengthening health worker capacity to implement routine contact tracing programs for at risk populations   Training in standardized TB control practices & case management  Develop TB screening capacity among TB community nurses  Development of policies and guidelines to standardize treatment of latent TB infection  Independent review of DOTS centres implementation of standardized protocols  Strengthen supervision and M & E  Strengthening the supply of quality assured anti-TB drugs at all DOTS units  Increase human resource capacity in countries for NTP core staff and additional microscopy assistants  Health systems infrastructure development in outer island settings"	12281.01|12230.01|12250.04|12250.01 	3693
2410494	African Development Bank (AFDB)		Extension of the Cap-Bon Citrus Fruit Protection Area		The main goal of the project is to enable Tunisia to maintain its position on the international market by increasing citrus fruit exports by 12,000 tons by the year 2003. The project will also contribute significantly to reducing poverty in rural areas by doubling income by the year 2003. The plan is to produce an additional annual citrus output of 23,855 tons by improving orchard yield on 1,835 ha. Specifically, the project provides for the construction of irrigation networks over 1,835 ha, the construction of an insectarium for biological control, and the development of 4 aquifer replenishment sites. The ADB loan will be used to finance 70 per cent of the total project cost and will cover 100 per cent of the foreign exchange cost.	31120.05|31140.02|31120.06|31191.02|31120.07|31140.05 	798

2326855	Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)		Rural Housing Program	Rural Housing Recons/Rehab	On Feb. 4, 1976, a disastrous earthquake hit Guatemala City and adjacent areas, killing some 23,000 persons, injuring 77,000 persons and leaving 1 million homeless. In its efforts to rebuild the country, the Government of Guatemala placed heavy emphasis on housing construction, since an estimated 258,000 dwellings were destroyed, more than 141,000 of them in rural areas. An overwhelming percentage of these homes belonged to the poorest sectors of the population. As part of its support for the nation's reconstruction effort, the Inter-American Bank extended this loan. It will be used by the Banco de Desarrollo Agricola (BANDESA), the nation's agricultural Bank, through a special reconstruction fund, the Fondo Extraardinario Especifico de Reconstruccion (FEER), to grant credits to individuals, directly through federations of cooperatives, through cooperatives themselves or other associations for home construction in rural areas where homes were damaged or destroyed by the earthquake. Priority attention will be given to the neediest elements of the population. The loan represents a strong cooperative Inter-American effort on the part of various Bank member countries to help Guatemala in its reconstruction task, since it was made interest free from the Social Progress Trust Fund which the Bank administers for the United States Government and the Bank is utilizing in this loan repayments made in the currencies of six countries-Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela-for disbursements.	73010.04|73010.01 	1570

The project consists of the following four components: Component 1) the project will provide subdistricts with unearmarked block grants that can be Rps. 500, 750, or 1,000 million rupiah, depending on their population. Component 2) district and subdistrict grants also include a small fund to provide operational support. This grant will allow the communities to organize planning seminars, contract advisers while they review proposals, carry out site visits to neighboring areas, and the like. Component 3) The Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas Project (SPADA) includes three major types of implementation support. The different levels of government are backed by a technical assistance structure that includes a national management team, an oversight and monitoring unit in each province, and a multisectoral support team in each participating district. Component 4) SPADA requires a sophisticated system for monitoring and evaluation. Project managers need to know in more than casual ways whether the project is on course and whether interventions are having their desired effect.	51010.05|15110.02|15150.05|51010.01|51010.02 	1637

40301375	Global Environment Facility (GEF)		Ecomarkets		description:The development objective of the proposed project is to increase the production of environmental services in Costa Rica by supporting the development of markets and private sector providers for services supplied by privately owned forests, including protection of biological diversity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and provision of hydrological services. The global environmental objective of the proposed project is to foster biodiversity conservation and preserve important forest ecosystems through conservation easements on privately-owned lands outside of protected areas in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in Costa Rica.  The project will strengthen offices within the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), as well as local and regional non-governmental organizations, responsible for the execution, promotion, supervision, and monitoring of the forest conservation program. Results of project activities generating global benefits would include: (a) an additional 50,000 hectares of privately owned lands in Tortuguero, La Amistad Caribe, and Osa Conservation Areas incorporated into Costa Rica&rsquo;s conservation easement program; (b) establishment of a financial instrument to support conservation easements in Costa Rica over the long term; and (c) increased landowner participation in, and benefits from, forest conservation-related activities within the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in Costa Rica.;implementation status:The project implementation is satisfactory.

2417580	World Bank - International Development Association (IDA)		Pakistan PRSC I - Supplemental Financing	Public Administration, Law, and Justice (Central government administration): 36, Health and other social services (Health): 16, Education (General education sector): 16, Energy and mining (Power): 16, Information and communications (Telecommunications): 16	On October 8, 2005, a powerful earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale hit northern Pakistan. Pakistan has borne the brunt of the earthquake, especially 5 northeastern districts of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and three districts covering most of had Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with enormous loss of life and devastation of infrastructure and property.  In response to the earthquake, the Bank announced that US$20 million would be available to the Government of Pakistan through reallocations from existing projects. This amount was doubled to US$ 40 million on October 11, through additional identified reallocations.  The Bank is preparing a proposed package of US$ 470 million to help Pakistan deal with the reconstruction effort and safeguard the on-going reform and poverty reduction program. This package will include: (1) Supplemental Financing of US$ 150 million under the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 1) and of US$ 50 million under NWFP SAC 2; (2)additional financing for existing projects (AJK Community Infrastructure and Services Project, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Project, and Highways Rehabilitation Project); and (3) reallocation of part of the proceeds of AJK Community Infrastructure and Services Project, Second NWFP Community Infrastructure and Services Project, and the NWFP On-Farm Water Management Project. In addition to this immediate response, if the Damage and Needs Assessment identifies unmet needs, and if the Government requests it, the Bank could prepare an Emergency Recovery Program. Even without a formal Damage and Needs Assessment--expected in mid-November-- it is clear that the economic impact of the earthquake is sizeable. Early estimates suggest that the reconstruction costs of the lost infrastructure will run into several billions of US dollars and thus will have a sizeable impact on the overall financing needs of the Government of Pakistan (as well as the Government of the NWFP). The report covers the proposed Supplemental Financing of US$ 150 million, which will support the sustained implementation of the PRSC reform program, and help finance part of the gap in resources incurred as a result of the earthquake This is consistent with Bank policy as reflected in OP 8.60, according to which supplemental financing may be provided for a development policy operation for which an anticipated gap in financing jeopardizes a reform program that is otherwise proceeding on schedule and in compliance with the agreed policy agenda.	73010.01 	2810

2406449	Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)		Support for Three Nongovernmental Organizations		The informal sector contributes an estimated 8 percent of GDP to the Chilean economy and employs nearly a quarter of the country's urban labor force. This program targets some 2,500 informal sector work in the areas of manufacturing, services and trade. No fewer than 70 percent of beneficiaries will be women. The intermediaries involved in the program are private, nonprofit organizations that have all participated in previous Bank financings: the Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito Liberacion, CREDICOOP, the Corporacion de Promocion para la Pequena Empresa, PROPESA, and Finanzas Internacionales y Nacionales para la Mujer, FINAM (the Chilean affiliate of Women's World Banking). Located in marginal urban areas throughout the country, the organizations are dedicated to raising the incomes of microentrepreneurs and the self-employed, along with their families.  Their clients are workers who require support in terms of credit, advisory services, technical assistance and training. This enables the microentrepreneurs to make the technical and economic progress necessary to gain access to the commercial banking sector.  	92030.01 	1176

2405595	Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)		Urban Improvement Program		The program will improve the housing and sanitary conditions of some 47,000 low-income families while promoting the private ownership of homes in urban communities of over 3,000 residents throughout Chile. The Bank's resources will be used by the Ministry of the Interior to carry out the Low-Income Urban Area Improvement Program, which will be implemented by local governments in whose jurisdiction the projects are located. The program will subsidize up to 75 percent of the cost to each family of basic housing and sanitary improvements. It will involve four main components:  •Installing complete residential services, including water, sewage, electricity and occasionally gas;  •Realigning streets and alleys-and doing basic paving;  •Installing in-house sanitary units and connections, including bath facilities, kitchen and laundry areas:  •Subdividing land and delivering ownership deeds to each family.  In recent years, as the Chilean economy has expanded at a 5.5 percent average annual rate, the government has embarked on a program to eradicate extreme poverty throughout the country. In the housing sector, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development is charged with programs to provide new housing while MINTER administers programs to improve basic infrastructure and sanitation. In 1985, the government estimated that, of some 2.4 million dwelling units in the country, 410,000 lacked sanitary facilities of which some 135,000 were occupied by people living in extreme poverty. MINTER estimates the number of such dwellings lacking sanitary facilities today at 100,000 units. Under the Low-Income Urban Area Development Program, sanitary facilities have been installed in almost 86,000 houses with the help of two previous Bank loans totaling $81 million.	14020.03|43040.04|21020.02|16030.03|43030.05|14020.04|23050.01|23040.02 	1810

2443163	Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)		Scale up of Comprehensive HIV and AIDS Treatment, Care And Support		"Background and Summary:  The Program has as its primary focus strengthening treatment, care and support for people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. The Program seeks to address a major gap in the response to HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, build on programs initiated through other funding provided by the Global Fund and on existing prevention, treatment and care initiatives of government and other partners. It aims to scale up provision of antiretroviral treatment and related services such as counselling and testing, PMTCT and community care to ensure that a comprehensive package of HIV/AIDS treatment, care and support is available in all parts of the country.  The essential role that civil society organizations and the private sector play in providing and   supporting HIV/AIDS treatment and care and support will be enhanced through additional capacity building for these institutions. Aspects of HIV prevention included in the Program are those that are closely related to treatment, care and support initiatives.  The approach to be followed in scaling up HIV/AIDS treatment, care and support is to extend provision of ART to tertiary and secondary level health facilities in all the 37 States of the country. The Principal Recipient will establish new and strengthen existing services for counselling and testing, PMTCT, TB, adherence support and home-based care alongside centres providing ART. These will collectively fonn ""clusters"" for providing comprehensive HIV/AIDS care.  This new approach to scaling up ART involves developing a network or clusters of secondary and primary facilities that will provide comprehensive HIV/AIDS care, including ART.

The development objectives of these five Bank operations are: 1) to help safeguard and maintain the productive capacity of the countries' tourism sectors, notably by securing the industry's emergency needs in the aftermath of the September 11 events; 2) to enhance security at key airport and seaport facilities in line with international standards, with the aim of preventing further acts of terrorism and safeguarding the sub-region's image as a safe tourist destination; and 3) to strengthen the countries' institutional capacity to develop and implement security plans, procedures, and measures as mandated by the international civil aviation and marine transport regulatory agencies. There are two main project components. The first finances one critical import, low sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation, which is critical to the maintenance of economic activity in the tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-intensive tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery period. The second component finances the physical and technical resources needed for national port and aviation authorities, as well as individual airports and seaports, to upgrade security arrangements at key facilities and meet international regulations.	53040.04|15210.01|21040.02|73010.02|21010.03|15110.03|21010.02|33210.01|21050.01|21040.01|21050.02 	1503

The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications  thereof as the Borrower and the Association may agree upon from time to time to  achieve such objectives:  Part A: Resource Development and Investment  1. Development of long-term least-cost development plans for BPDB and BOGMC.  2. Assessment of the technical, economic and financial viability of the exploitation  of the coal deposits at Barapukuria.  3. Preparation and implementation of the priority investment program for the energy  sector.  Part B: Energy Pricing and Demand Management  1. Rationalization and restructuring of BPDB’s and PBSs’ electricity tariffs to  reflect the economic costs of supplying different consumer groups, and each year, if  necessary, increase their tariff rates in order to: (i) in the case of BPDB achieve an  adequate rate of return on revalued assets; and (ii) in the case of PBSs enable them  to cover their operating expenses and interest and an adequate proportion of their  investment programs.  2. Increase of the price of natural gas each year, as necessary, to achieve, as a  first step, equality with the economic costs of supply for each consumer group, and,  thereafter, to reduce the gap between the price of gas and that of substitute fuels in  order to mobilize resources for the Borrower.  3.

2016535	OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)		To alleviate poverty and reduce unemployment	<br>	This grant will help support an initiative to increase social productivity in Jordan. Developed by JOHUD, a non-government, non-profit agency, this community-based project aims to alleviate poverty and unemployment problems in the governorate of Mafraq, Jordan’s poorest region, by offering both training in business skills and job opportunities, and by providing loans for  small-scale enterprises. The JOHUD program will apply a three-pronged approach to alleviating poverty in Jordan. Awareness workshops designed to cultivate an understanding of social needs will play an integral role, discussing the  causes and effects of poverty and unemployment, and exploring available alternatives and opportunities. Health awareness topics, including nutrition, family planning, hygiene and communicable disease prevention, will be covered, as well as other relevant issues such as gender equality, social justice and legal rights. The project will also provide training for the poor in how to operate income-generating activities. The training will focus on developing economic awareness and providing instruction on how to start new businesses. Eligibility will be based upon participation in the awareness program  and the willingness of the applicants to engage in economic activities. Throughout the project, women applicants will be given priority. A credit scheme will be created to provide the poor with the small loans they need to start small-scale  enterprises. In all, some 4,000 people will benefit directly from various project activities.	12240.05|42010.01|16020.05|13030.03|24040.02|12250.01 	1601

2443375	Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)		Program to support the scale up of ART and HIV Testing and Counseling Services in 22 districts in Zimbabwe		PROGRAM DESCRIPTION  The prevalence of HIV infection in Zimbabwe is still one of the highest in the world, and HIV and  AIDS associated morbidity and mortality continue to rise. This results in adverse social and economic  consequences such as a growing number of orphans, vulnerable population sub-groups and reduced  economic outputs. Despite major efforts which have included, a comprehensive National response, the  critical areas of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV Testing and Counseling (T&C) services need  additional funding to achieve a substantial scale-up of these activities. In June 2006, approximately  10% of the Zimbabwean population were receiving HIV T&C services and only 4% (25,000) of those  who were in need of treatment were accessing ARTs.  The Program shall support the scale-up of ARTs and HIV T&C services in 22 districts in Zimbabwe,  which shall include the expansion of services in 12 districts covered by the Global Fund's Round 1  HIV/AIDS Grant No: ZIM-I02-GOI-H-00. The Program shall build on existing National strategies,  including Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT); TB and ART programs; care and  support for the chronically ill and families affected by HIV/AIDS; and HIV T&C services.  The HIV/AIDS component for the Zimbabwe Country Coordinating Mechanism's Global Fund  Round 6 Proposal shall be implemented by two Principal Recipients (PR) namely, the Zimbabwe  Association of Church Related Hospitals (ZACH) (Grant No: ZIM-506-G04-H) and the Principal  Recipient for this Grant, the National AIDS Council of Zimbabwe (NAC). The two PRs have been  nominated with a multi-sectoral approach in mind, in recognition of the importance of diversifying  management of funds to increase the absorptive capacity and assist in ensuring timely progress  towards the overall Program goal. The PRs shall provide grant funds to a broad range of SubRecipients  (SR) and Sub-Sub-Recipients, who shall also implement Program activities, which are  broadly related to the existing structures and strategies of both PRs.  The NAC shall manage funding to Sub-Recipients for Quality Assurance of drugs and other medical  products; quality assurance of laboratory services; human resources; training; infrastructure  development; PMTCT; ART delivery; treatment for Opportunistic Infections (01); HIV T&C  services; advocacy and community outreach; mass media; and monitoring and evaluation support. In addition, NAC shall also manage funding to Sub-Recipients for private sector activities such as client  initiated T&C; workplace policy programmes in 22 districts; and training and ART delivery.  Planned Activities: The Program's activities shall include,  â?¢ Sensitizing policy makers at national, provincial, district, and community level on the need for  HIV treatment  â?¢ Providing support to strengthen treatment advocacy in the 22 districts  â?¢ Providing PMTCT, ART delivery, and treatment for OIs  â?¢ Supporting private companies and public institutions in 22 districts to develop and implement  workplace policy programmes to reduce stigma, T&C, treatment literacy, post-test support,  management of OIs and ART treatment and monitoring  â?¢ Producing and distributing IEC and mass media campaign materials on stigma reduction,  importance of testing and counseling, TB&HIV co-infection and treatment literacy through  various media channels  â?¢ Supporting existing stand alone and mobile client initiated T&C sites in 22 districts  â?¢ Strengthening referral system between T&C, HIV care and treatment service providers and  communities in 22 districts  â?¢ Establishing T&C services integrated in MCH, OPD, and TB units at 2 health facilities in each of  the 22 districts  â?¢ Building capacity of primary and secondary caregivers to care for PLWHA in home including,  adherence support  â?¢ Strengthening the quality assurance for HIV/AIDS laboratory diagnosis and monitoring  â?¢ Assessing the health infrastructure of all health facilities in 22 districts to identify capacities and  gaps, and support the DHTs to develop district plans to address identified gaps  â?¢ Upgrading infrastructure of health facilities in 22 districts to provide T&C services and OI/ART  management  â?¢ Continuously monitoring and ensuring safe, effective and good quality medicines and related  substances are used in Zimbabwe  â?¢ Strengthening coordination of HIV/AIDS activities, including, ART at national, provincial and  district levels  â?¢ Recruiting and deploying health personnel to support ART in 22 districts  â?¢ Developing a computerized ART M&E database based on the harmonized ART M&E system to  consolidate data from field level to national  â?¢ Training health providers in OI/ART management, and provide ARV medicines to enrolled  patients  â?¢ Providing ARV medicines for Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)  â?¢ Building capacity of health workers in managing HIV/TB co-infection	13081.01|12230.01|13040.02|12110.03|13040.01|12220.04|12191.02|13040.04|13040.05|13040.03 	5086

The Government of Peru (GoP) will begin implementing the Strategic Budget Program for Disaster Vulnerability Reduction and Emergency Response (Programa Presupuestal Estrategico de Reduccion de Vulnerabilidad y Atencion de Emergencias por Desastres, PPE-RVAE) under the results-based budgeting framework and will focus primarily on health, water and sanitation as priority sectors. In addition, the formulation of an overall financial strategy, while seeking the right balance of emergency funds, excellent debt management service, and greater market access to additional funding, may be considered one of the key aspects of this operation. Throughout this process, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) aims to increase its capacity to mobilize resources in the event of a disaster and to strengthen financial and technical mechanisms related to investments in vulnerability reduction. The GoP is implementing a set of activities related to disaster risk management under the framework of a national vulnerability reduction policy. This document describes the actions undertaken to date by the GoP in support of these activities. The Bank agrees that this national policy constitutes a good foundation to further reduce the country's exposure to disaster risk in a sustainable manner.	74010.08|74010.01|74010.04|74010.03 	1560

The case&nbsp;</div><div>notification rate is 117 per 100,000 population and is the 3</div><div>rd</div><div>&nbsp;highest among the 53 countries of the WHO&nbsp;</div><div>European Region.&nbsp;</div><div>While there are substantial achievements of the National TB Programme during recent years, important&nbsp;</div><div>challenges remain to be addressed. As in the other former Soviet Union republics, resistance to anti-TB&nbsp;</div><div>drugs represents a serious obstacle to effective control of the TB epidemic. The data of the Drug&nbsp;</div><div>Resistance Survey in 2007 revealed very high MDR-TB prevalence of 24.8% among new smear positive&nbsp;</div><div>cases and 53.7% - among previously treated cases.&nbsp;</div><div>The Government is committed to fight the disease and increasingly allocates financial, human and&nbsp;</div><div>infrastructural resources for TB control. However, substantial financial gaps exist, especially in regard to&nbsp;</div><div>the complex and costly interventions in DR-TB management. To bridge the programmatic and financial&nbsp;</div><div>gap, the CCM has decided to solicit additional support from the Global Fund in Round 8 in addition to the&nbsp;</div><div>ongoing TB project from Round 6. This application is a re-submission of the non-approved Round&nbsp;</div><div>proposal.&nbsp;</div><div>The overall &nbsp;Goal of the Project is &nbsp;To reduce the burden of tuberculosis in Kyrgyzstan by&nbsp;</div><div>consolidation of DOTS framework and its expansion by scaling up the management of drugresistant tuberculosis. While further strengthening essential &nbsp;DOTS interventions remains the key&nbsp;</div><div>requirement for preventing resistance, it has become clear that, in conditions of extremely high DR-TB&nbsp;</div><div>burden, timely diagnosis and proper treatment of DR-TB cases are necessary for the overall success in&nbsp;</div><div>combating the epidemic and achieving TB control targets and disease-related Millennium Development&nbsp;</div><div>Goals.&nbsp;</div><div>Two main Objectives have been identified for the project:&nbsp;</div><div>1. To consolidate DOTS framework through strengthening programme management, improving&nbsp;</div><div>TB case detection and diagnosis and quality treatment of TB cases&nbsp;</div><div>Activities under this Objective have designed to sustain priority TB control interventions that are&nbsp;</div><div>currently supported by the Round 6 TB project. Therefore, funding for most of them is requested for&nbsp;</div><div>Years 3-5 of the Round 9 timeline. In addition, a number of new activities have been added&nbsp;</div><div>compared to the Round 6 project according to &nbsp;the emerging needs, such as strengthening TB&nbsp;</div><div>information system, patient incentives and support to local authorities and community involvement in&nbsp;</div><div>TB control. Health system strengthening is an &nbsp;integral part of the project through continuing&nbsp;</div><div>involvement of Primary Health Care in TB case detection, treatment follow up and community and&nbsp;</div><div>family work. Activities:&nbsp;</div><div>1.1. Strengthening management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the National&nbsp;</div><div>Tuberculosis Programme&nbsp;</div><div>1.2. Strengthening TB laboratory network&nbsp;</div><div>1.3. Improving TB case management&nbsp;</div><div>1.4. Strengthening Primary Health Care involvement in TB control&nbsp;</div><div>1.5. TB Advocacy, communication and social mobilisation (ACSM)&nbsp;</div><div>2. To expand access to diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis&nbsp;</div><div>Activities under this Objective aim at scaling up the DR-TB management programme in the country to&nbsp;</div><div>ensure universal access to DR-TB diagnosis and treatment by the end of the project. It is foreseen to&nbsp;</div><div>enrol a total of 2,160 MDR-TB patients over five years from the civilian and penitentiary sectors. The&nbsp;</div><div>project is built to support the country’s application to the Green Light Committee for expansion of&nbsp;</div><div>treatment cohort, approved in July 2007. The accomplishment of &nbsp;this Objective will be reached through strengthening the human and infrastructural capacities, establishment of routine drug&nbsp;</div><div>resistance surveillance throughout the country, upgrading the laboratory services and provision of&nbsp;</div><div>up-to-date treatment of DR-TB cases with appropriate patient support to ensure adherence.&nbsp;</div><div>Activities:&nbsp;</div><div>2.1. Strengthening national capacities for management of drug-resistant tuberculosis&nbsp;</div><div>2.2. Drug resistance surveillance and diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases&nbsp;</div><div>2.3. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases&nbsp;</div><div>2.4. Patient support programme for drug-resistant tuberculosis patients&nbsp;</div><div>2.5. Operational research on drug-resistant tuberculosis&nbsp;</div><div>The proposal has a country-wide scope and covers the needs of both civilian and penitentiary sectors. It&nbsp;</div><div>aims at ensuring universal coverage with diagnosis and treatment of DR-TB: all TB patients will have&nbsp;</div><div>access to drug susceptibility testing and all patients diagnosed with DR-TB will have access to second&nbsp;</div><div>line treatment. It is expected that on a longer run, the project will contribute to improving the key TB&nbsp;</div><div>outcome indicators (case detection rate and treatment success rate) and decreasing the prevalence of&nbsp;</div><div>MDR-TB.&nbsp;</div><div>The Global Fund financial resources will be additional to domestic resources that will be allocated to&nbsp;</div><div>cover substantial costs of the staff, medical interventions and facility expenses. The Round 9 project will&nbsp;</div><div>be fully complementary to the support available from Round 6 as shown in the Workplan and Budget files.&nbsp;</div><div>In line with the Global Fund’s recommendations on dual track financing, two Principal Recipients have&nbsp;</div><div>been nominated for the grant: the National Centre of Phtysiology and Social Foundation “Project HOPE&nbsp;</div><div>Kyrgyzstan”, the latter representing non-governmental sector.&nbsp;</div><div>The duration of the project is 5 years starting 1 July 2010; the total requested budget is USD 26,273,556&nbsp;</div><div>(USD 7,811,885 for the first two years).</div>	12182.01|12110.03|12191.02|12250.04|15150.02|15130.06 	6987

Its principal benefit will be to provide a coordinated framework for the balance of payments, and budgetary support. This will reduce transaction costs, will focus attention on development priorities, and allow the Government to mobilize external financing that would not otherwise be available. The project will further facilitate: the consolidation of the institutional framework for good governance; improvements in service delivery, and performance of key sectors, including the judiciary, education, health, agriculture, and institutions supporting private sector development; increased attention to capacity building requirements in the public sector; and, strengthening of public expenditure management capacity, and improving the policy alignment of external financing, by channeling resources through the budget. While risks remain, namely, capacity constraints; failure to contain power sector subsidies; corruption; and, unemployment, the project high priority on capacity building, on management to improve cost-recovery, and, Government commitments, should outweigh those risks.	15120.02|15110.03|25010.01|12110.01|15130.03|11110.01|31110.01 	1630

The PRSC program supports selective key reforms that will directly contribute to pro-poor growth by a) creating fiscal space for, and improving the effectiveness of growth enhancing public investments, and, b) improving the investment climate. The PRSC program also supports Nepal's track record of meaningful reforms in improving service delivery by assisting the government in developing annual benchmarks, consistent with the broad reform objectives, and, by providing the fiscal and technical resources necessary to accelerate the reform momentum. The PRSC process supports the promotion of social inclusion, by improving the effectiveness of targeted programs; improving access to schooling for excluded groups, and, by encouraging civil service diversity. It also supports the government's strategy to improve governance by improving the effectiveness of the civil service, strengthening anti-corruption and accountability institutions, improving the functioning of key agencies, and, improving financial management and procurement practices. The improvements in governance that are supported by the PRSC are designed to bring more accountable, efficient, and a less corrupt government, that will create a more favorable investment climate, and lead to better service delivery. Nonetheless, risks include the potential return to a prolonged period of conflict, that would dampen growth prospects, and the impact of structural reforms on poverty, while the efforts of reform-minded technocrats, may be crowded  by political interference, thus threaten the sustainability of reforms, and in addition, a further worsening of global economic conditions may undermine the impact of growth-enhancing reforms. However, many of the reforms outlined have a wide degree of support across the political spectrum, and from civil society, as they have been based on consensus-building exercises and stakeholder consultations, and, the Bank will provide a loan acceleration clause that would allow the Bank to demand immediate repayment of the proposed loan by the Borrower, in case reforms are reversed, or materially changed.	25010.05|15110.05|15120.02|16010.06|51010.03|15140.04|15120.04|15110.02 	2661

2403844	Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)		Coffee Pulp Plant		Subproductos de Cafe, S.A., a mixed company located in San Rafael de Ojo de Agua in Costa Rica, operates a dehydrated coffee pulp plant. This pulp, the waste from the coffee-making process, is used as an energy ingredient in manufacturing balanced feed for cattle. Coffee pulp can replace up to 25 percent of the corn, sorghum, wheat bran and cotton hulls currently used in cattle feed. To help the pulp plant to reach a production capacity of 6,000 tons a year by 1982, the Bank in 1981 authorized an equity financing of $290,698 from the Venezuelan Trust Fund to purchase stock in the company. The Bank's resources will enable the company to build silos where the stored coffee pulp can become more palatable and more nutritious prior to processing. The project is expected to save Costa Rica some $1 million a year in foreign exchange and generate up to 50 new jobs.	32120.06 	889

2412595	Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA)		Chemical Industries - Pulp Mill	<br>	PROJECT  Chemical Industries - Pulp Mill.  The secondary sector, which accounts for only 15% of the country's GOP, ranks first among the Government's priorities which  are now directed towards the promotion of private investments in the processing industries.    The project concerns the building of a pulp mill at Edea, a town situated at some 85km from the industrial city of Douala.    The initial annual production of the mill is expected to reach 122,000 metric tons of sulphate pulp. It will be worth noting that the chemical processing of pulp has progressed spectacularly since 1975 through its numerous applications in the paper industries. Similarly, for the last twenty five years, the use of sulphate in the chemical processing of pulp products has been increasing steadily.    The forest which covers extensive areas in the immediate vicinity of the mill-site is a substantial source of timber which from the point of view of quantity as well as quality shall provide a solid basis for the proper implementation of the project. Experiments carried out in Canada and West Germany have in fact shown that the varieties of the Cameroon's timber species have the properties required for pulp and paper processing.    The project will also involve the building of workshops, as well as that of a laboratory to monitor production quality, a first-aid  infirmary and housing for the supervisory staff.    OBJECTIVE:   This project is in keeping with the general development policy of the Government which calls for self-reliance  through the utilization of raw materials available locally.  The pulp which will be processed exclusively for export, will be a  source of substantial foreign exchange earnings.    Furthermore, the implementation of the project is expected to provide employment for 12,000 people in the Douala/Edea region.	32181.01|32120.07|32182.01|32120.09 	1880

The forest which covers extensive areas in the immediate vicinity of the mill-site is a substantial source of timber which from the point of view of quantity as well as quality shall provide a solid basis for the proper implementation of the project. Experiments carried out in Canada and West Germany have in fact shown that the varieties of the Cameroon's timber species have the properties required for pulp and paper processing.    The project will also involve the building of workshops, as well as that of a laboratory to monitor production quality, a first-aid  infirmary and housing for the supervisory staff.    OBJECTIVE:   This project is in keeping with the general development policy of the Government which calls for self-reliance  through the utilization of raw materials available locally.  The pulp which will be processed exclusively for export, will be a  source of substantial foreign exchange earnings.    Furthermore, the implementation of the project is expected to provide employment for 12,000 people in the Douala/Edea region.	32181.01|32120.07|32182.01|32120.09 	1880

Currently, the Dominican Republic's labor market suffers from short-term unemployment, low participation rate, and highly informal job-search networks. The project seeks to facilitate opportunities for access to the labor market through work training, counseling, and modernization of the country's regulatory framework for labor. The program is directed at a target population different than that currently served by traditional training. The beneficiaries are concentrated in groups that are not the focus of any existing programs: lower-income populations and individuals with less than secondary education, especially young women. This program is consistent with Bank strategies for the job-training sector in that it includes vulnerable groups in training activities. The program will encourage expansion of cost-effective initiatives with the greatest impact.	16020.03|11330.01|16020.05 	996

SAC 2 also aims to launch initial reforms in the health sector. The operation proposes to cover four broad policy areas (i) consolidating reforms in the financial sector; (ii) implementing the restructuring of the energy sector; (iii) continuing the implementation of pension reforms and initiating health sector reforms; and (iv) strengthening the transparency, accountability, and effectiveness of public administration. The financial sector reforms would help to promote growth through increased (and increasingly efficient) financial intermediation. Pension, health and public administration reform would ultimately support ongoing fiscal consolidation. Energy sector reforms would support both growth and fiscal consolidation by overcoming episodes of supply shortfall and ensuring the financial self-sufficiency of energy utilities. Increased institutional transparency and accountability and increased focus on implementation capacity are themes thread through each of the five policy areas.	15140.01|24010.02|24030.02|12110.02|51010.03|23010.02|16010.04 	1518
