The project also includes the feasibility study and subsequent detailed engineering studies for the Hargeisa-Borama road with a spur to Tug-Wajale, as well as the reviewing and updating of the 1966 transport survey of Somalia. The Berbera-Hargeisa road connects the modern port of Berbera with the livestock producing areas of Northern Somalia and will therefore facilitate and improve the transportation and exporting of livestock, Somalia's chief foreign exchange earner. The balance of U.A. 9.6 million (in foreign and local costs) will be provided by IDA Credit. This is the third project  ADB has financed with the World Bank Group, the first two being the Kenya Paper Mills (with IFC) and the Malawi power project (with IDA). 	21020.02 	1009

2410636	African Development Bank (AFDB)		Dande Smallholder Irrigation Project		The objective of the project is to increase agricultural production and rural incomes in order to contribute to poverty reduction. The project is expected to increase and stabilize agricultural production in the project area through the establishment of an irrigation scheme, involving the construction of a storage dam on the Dande River with an estimated safe yield of 46.6 million cubic meters of water per year to irrigate a net area of 4.300 hectares. This will support a double crop production system for cotton, beans, maize and vegetables. It will also provide an interception dyke of 6.3 km to be constructed at the edge of the   escarpment; a 12.5 km all-weather access road; three storage tanks of 5,000 liters each for water supply; a sprinkler network; and buildings. The project will also improve the social infrastructure through the upgrading of two existing primary schools and construction of three new ones.    The project will involve the allocation of land in the irrigation scheme to 2,405 small-scale farmers, thus facilitating an increase in productivity and income. The project will also generate employment opportunities for both seasonal and permanent workers. The average net farm income per beneficiary is estimated to increase more than three-fold per annum at full development. The total population that will benefit from the project is estimated at 18,759, with additional 30,000  people benefiting from the project directly or indirectly as a result of improved standard of living, better basic health and educational facilities, improved access roads, improved water supply and diversification of diet. As women engaged in agriculture in the project area constitute almost 61 per cent of the total agricultural population of the area, the project will have a direct positive impact on their activities. Thirty per cent of heads of households of the target group are women. who will be incorporated as land leaseholders in the project. The choice of sprinkler irrigation will allow the project to minimize permanent open water. Under the project, environmental awareness and community development training to the rural community will be implemented by the Ministry of Health and NGOs.    The loan was approved by the Board on 2 July 1997 and the ADB will finance 50.5 per cent of the project cost. The project will be co-financed by: ADF (UA 3.00 million), BADEA (UA 8.17 million), OPEC Fund (UA 4.30 million] and the Government of Zimbabwe (UA 3.84 million). The project will be implemented over a period of 7 years.	14020.04|31120.05|11220.03|21020.02|16010.11|31140.04|31140.02|31140.03 	2589

It seeks to provide better access to the country's inland development poles as well as improve communications between the principal and the secondary centers of activity. Specifically, the project will safeguard the classified road network; reduce transportation costs; and improve road safety for users. Two road sections will be constructed. The first road, 432.7 km long, will be widened to 7.60 m and reinforced with bitumen coated dressing. The second, 340.8 km long, will be reinforced with bitumen coated dressing. A total of 19 crossing structures will be built to provide drainage for part of the classified network. The implementation of the project will contribute to significant upgrading of  the transport sector and thus enhance the economic and social development of the country. Besides reducing maintenance and vehicle operating costs, the project will create jobs at the construction phase, and also through new activities generated by the road network. The road will facilitate collection and marketing of products by linking production centers to the markets.  It will provide benefits to women, especially those living in rural areas and engaged in small-scale farming, fishing and crafts. The negative environmental impact of the project will be negligible since the roads already exist and are paved. The loan was approved by the Board on 26 November 1997 and the ADB will finance 68.7 per cent of the project's total cost while the Government of Tunisia will meet the remainder. The project will be implemented over a period of 34 months.	21020.02 	1779

2411959	African Development Bank (AFDB)		Nasia Rice Project		The failure of food production to keep pace with increasing demand and the consequent rise in both  food imports and prices explains the priority given to food production by the government of Ghana.  Agriculture remains the backbone of the Ghanaian economy and contributes, together with forestry, some 70  per cent of the country's export earnings. The ADB project revolves around the development of  20,000 acres of rice embracing a group of farmers each operating a minimum farm unit of 250 acres. A  rice mill with a capacity of 4-5 tons of paddy per hour (or 17,000 tons annually) will also be installed as  a part of the project.  	32120.06|31120.06 	658
2410640	African Development Bank (AFDB)		Electricity Transmission Project		The objective of the project is to expand the supply of electricity and improve the reliability of supply from the existing power transmission network. The project involves the installation and operation of 132- Kv double circuit lines, which are expected to relieve the current overload on the existing 66-Kv grid. The new lines will increase the number of electricity connections to about 49,000 new consumers by the end of the year 2005. Power losses in the national grid will be reduced from 14.5 per cent to 13.7 per cent by the year 2002. This will save enough electricity to meet demand for an additional 1,611 consumers. These additional connections and reliability of supply will contribute to increased revenue for the Central Electricity Board (CEB) and improve its financial performance. The availability and reliability of power supply will also contribute to the growth of economic and social activities in the various sectors of the economy. The steady supply of electricity will eliminate damage to electrical appliances, reduce the use of electric generators and enhance the quality of the environment.     The loan was approved by the Board on 19 November 1997 and the ADB will provide 73 per cent of the project cost while the remaining 27 per cent will be provided by the Central Electricity Board. The project will be implemented over a 29-month period.	23040.03|23010.02 	1409
